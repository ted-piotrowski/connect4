# Take-home coding project

Implement the following multi-player game of Connect 4

## Game rules
- Users connect to a web service and are anonymously matched with one other user
- Board is 7x6 (width x height)
- Players take turns dropping a token into one of the columns
- If a player connects 4 in any direction, they win
- If the board fills up, the game is a tie

## Requirements
- Users must be able to play without an account
- Games must be stored forever
- Players within a single game must not be able to submit moves for each other
- The game interface must display board state
- Document your implementation

## Optional bonus feature
- Allow players in a game to exchange messages

## Psst
- Ask us any and all questions — there is no such thing as a “dumb” question
- Feel free to bounce ideas off us (e.g. architecture)
- Smile and have fun :)
